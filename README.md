<p>This simple project is an exercise of the introductory course to Java provided by <a href="https://www.buenosaires.gob.ar/educacion/codo-codo" target="_blank">"Codo a Codo 4.0"</a>. The data used for this exercise was partially created from scratch and taken from reference pages like <a href="https://mercadolibre.com" target="_blank">Mercadolibre</a>. The web design and page layout is based on the design of the free template granted by <a href="https://almundo.com.ar/paquetes-turisticos" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>, which is also used to style the whole app.

The purpose of the exercise was to encompass all basics concepts approached by the course: Java and OOP concepts, MVC design pattern, Server Side Rendering, and data persistance with a Relational Database (MySQL).
